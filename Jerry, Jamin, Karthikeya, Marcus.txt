username should probably not allow to be empty.
missing input request for item swap
Would be an improvement to be able to buy multiple potions at once.
Game attempts to go back to a menu when it ends and then crashes.  I think this has to do with if you go to the item swap menu too many times
final boss outputs you lost like 5 times.
healing potions allow you to go over your max hp.
Might have been a bit easier and more reduced in overall code if you used more polymorphism to deal with the different types of items.
Items such as weapons, potions should have all been stored on the player when equiped instead of being strings.

Otherwise Great work!
